# Java Templates

I am so tired of looking for simple examples of things to make a quick start when I begin a project or add a new function to a project. Somehow the art of writing good tutorials and HOWTOs has been lost. So this repository will contain templates for things that I use regularly, but seldom enough to forget how to quickly implement them. With quickly I mean withing 5 or 10 minutes.
